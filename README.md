# FakeApi
Technical test

To log in use a fakeApi in Reqres. To login you must use the following credentials: email: "eve.holt@reqres.in" password: "cityslicka"
For posts, comments, and users use the Jsonplaceholder apis, due to lack of time the favorites and deleteAll functionality was not add.
The proposed architecture is MVVM
URLSession for requests.
SwiftUI is the chosen framework
